## Please note before working:

- This repo must not contain any images/videos that are intended to be sent between clients, as this takes up lots of space. If files are to be transfered between clients, please save them locally onto the computer itself.
- If you have already started working on the project before this repo was made available, you can just copy your current directory's work into this repo.

Reminder that the demo date is on the 28 February 2024. Good luck and try to have fun!

This implementation of a chat program based on java sockets and javaFX required the Intelliji IDE and the maven javaFX dependencies.
To use the program, open the folder in Intelliji IDE and accept the prompt for maven dependencies.
JDK 16.0.1 is recommended - same as Narga computers.
Firstly run the ChatServer class to start the server.
Then run the ChatClient class to create a client and connect to the server, followed by the login GUI and client screen.
